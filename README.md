# PIDApp: Pulse Intervals Detection App
The PIDApp is a graphical application made with the R Shiny package to *detect and process pulse intervals* measured with pothoplethismography (PPG), based on both manual and automatic procedures.

## PIDApp versions
The development of a more comprehensive version of the app, and the related documentation is currently ongoing. For now, this repository includes the versions of the app used in two studies to process the BVP signal recorded with the E4 wristband (Empatica, Milan):

- `E4validation`: App version used in the study Menghini, L., Gianfranchi, E., Cellini, N., Patron, E., Tagliabue, M., & Sarlo, M. (2019). Stressing the accuracy: Wrist‚Äêworn wearable sensor validation over different conditions. *Psychophysiology, 56*(11), e13441. https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13441

- `vmHRV-selfRegulation`: App version used in the study Menghini, L., Fuochi, G., Sarlo, M. Inter- and intraindividual relationships between vagally-mediated heart rate variability and self-regulatory processes: An ecological momentary assessment (*in preparation*), whose ongoing data pre-processing and data analysis are available at https://github.com/Luca-Menghini/vmHRV-selfRegulation
